        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Management-UCR 3rd Year Student & Part-time Blogger ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a full time student of UCR, I am constantly balancing work, studies and fun activities. I am currently majoring in business, with a concentration in management. I am a dedicated student and worker who is determined to complete my bachelorâ€™s degree so that I can begin my career in human resources. Along the way, I hope to guide other students, like me, who started out their education with little knowledge of the work-life balance, learning process, and resources available. I hope that this website will be of help to those students, so that you may all succeed throughout college and the rest of your life. Personally, I started out majoring in pre-business, but I didnâ€™t know what I wanted for myself in the future. Confused, I talked to as many people as possible, making as many connections and friendships as possible. Through these relationships, I was able to learn quality time-management, and social skills, as well as many other things. One of the most important takeaways, however, was that I got to learn more about myself, which helped me decide to concentrate in Management. I am a very social person, which I realized over time, and picked up a lot of leadership skills by joining clubs and organizations. I noticed that I also liked helping other people, and resolving disputes. I decided that I could do all of these things in the future with a job in Human Resources.<br><br>
        In my free time, I like to read and attend as many cultural events as possible, (as I love learning about different experiences and cultures). My advice to my readers is to establish as many connections with people (whether it be professors, TAâ€™s or fellow students), as possible so that you can ensure your success. Regarding my previous work experience, I have been engaged in many job and internship opportunities throughout my college life. My first internship was at COMPANY J, where they required me to work in Information Technology. Here, I answered phone calls, communicating in the most effective manner possible, to ensure client satisfaction. I maintain a professional attitude, and enjoyed talking to each of the customers and helping them in any way possible.<br><br>
        At my most current position at K Company Inc., I am interning for the HR dept. I hope to soon work my way up and secure a permanent job with the company. So far, I have developed technological skills, (Microsoft, Google, etc.) as well as interpersonal/communication skills. With the help of my previous experiences in making relationships through my entire college life, as well as those experiences from my internships and jobs, creating new professional relationships comes easily for me, now. I have also experienced the process of recruitment and termination for employees as well as the importance of benefits. I have very much enjoyed my experiences here at K Company Inc. and I hope that I can help guide my fellow readers to be as successful and satisfied as I am today.
